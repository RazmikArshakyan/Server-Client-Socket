# C++ Server-Client Socket

## Overview

The C++ Server-Client Socket application is designed to showcase a fundamental implementation of a client-server model using sockets on the Windows operating system. This application establishes a communication channel between a server and multiple clients, enabling seamless data exchange.

### How it Works

#### Server Side

- **Listening for Connections:**
  The server sets up a socket to listen for incoming connections. When a client initiates a connection, the server accepts the connection request.

- **Handling Multiple Clients:**
  The server is capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously. It creates a new thread or process for each accepted connection, allowing for concurrent communication with multiple clients.

- **Data Communication:**
  Once connected, the server and clients can send and receive data through the established sockets. This communication follows a request-response model, where clients can request information or send data to the server, and the server responds accordingly.

#### Client Side

- **Connecting to the Server:**
  The client initiates a connection to the server by providing the server's IP address and port number. Upon successful connection, the client can start sending and receiving data.

- **Data Communication:**
  Similar to the server, the client communicates with the server by sending and receiving data through the established socket. This bidirectional communication allows for interactive and dynamic exchanges.

### Key Features

- **Scalability:**
  The application is designed to handle multiple clients concurrently, making it scalable for various scenarios where multiple clients need to communicate with a central server.

- **Flexibility:**
  The server-client interaction is flexible, supporting a range of data types and structures. It can be adapted for diverse applications, from simple message passing to more complex data exchanges.

- **Simplicity:**
  The codebase is kept simple and easy to understand, making it an excellent starting point for learning about socket programming and client-server communication in a Windows environment.
